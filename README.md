# EcoPulse — Data Pathways to a Healthier Bangalore
**Team:** Code4Planets  
**Lead:** Deepika M

## Overview
**EcoPulse** is a data-driven project built for the **NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025** under the theme  
*“Data Pathways to Healthy Cities and Human Settlements.”*  

The project focuses on **Bangalore**, analyzing its **Waste, Water, and Climate** conditions using  
**NASA Earth data** and local civic datasets.  
We combined **AI/ML**, **IoT**, and **Civil Engineering** ideas to identify risks and design sustainable, smart city solutions.

*(7-slide PPT covering data analysis, ML insights, IoT concepts, and Civil Engineering solutions.)*

## Key Findings
- **Waste:** 12,258 TPD generated; only 37% treated → sanitation and emission risks.  
- **Water:** High BOD (2–3 mg/L) and unsafe coliform levels → unsafe for drinking.  
- **Climate:** Rising PM2.5/PM10 → moderate air pollution risk (Air Risk Index ~0.55).  
- **ML Analysis:** Waste and water risk zones detected; pollution patterns linked to temperature and wind speed.  

**City Health Score:** 0.45 → moderate environmental risk, needs smart interventions.
